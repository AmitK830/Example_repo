# Machine Learning Projects
## Every Projects Started with there purpose to solve business problems
## After that Understanding the dataset
## Followed By Data Wrangling & Data Cleasing
## Then a Deep Exploratory Data Analysis done using Python libraries
## Handling NULL values using different methods (like KNN Imputer or MICE)
## Outlier detection
## Feature Engineering & Feature Scaling
## Split the dataset into train & test set
## After that different model is build and check diiferent metrcis to find how model behave
## Model to who pass some threshold or business criteria will be selected
## At Last a Generalized Model is Selected which can run in real world
